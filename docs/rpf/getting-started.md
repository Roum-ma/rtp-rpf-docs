# Getting Started with RPF

## What is RPF

**RPF** is a modification for Minecraft Java Edition that allows you to use multiple resource packs with item model definitions *(hereafter we will simply call them `item model`)*, even if all resource packs modify the same item! You can read more about why *this* mod is needed in the ["How It Works"](how-it-works.md) section.


## Installation
 1) Install [Fabric Loader](https://docs.fabricmc.net/players/installing-fabric/).
 2) Install [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) as a mod.
 3) Install [RPF](https://modrinth.com/mod/rpf) as a mod.
 4) Done!
