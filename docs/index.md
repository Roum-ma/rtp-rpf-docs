## Why RPF & RPT?

Minecraft's resource pack system loads only the top-priority pack's model for each item. This makes it difficult to combine multiple resource packs that modify different items.

**RPF (Resource Packs Fusion)** solves this by introducing a delegation system - packs can selectively override models and delegate the rest to lower-priority packs.

**RPT (Resource Packs Tools)** adds powerful features like templates, variables, and conditional models, making it easier to create dynamic resource packs without requiring custom model data or separate mods.

## Quick Example

### RPF Delegation
```json
{
  "type": "rpf:select",
  "property": "minecraft:custom_data",
  "cases": [
    {
      "when": { "special_sword": true },
      "model": { "type": "minecraft:model", "model": "item/special_sword" }
    }
  ],
  "delegate": true
}
```
This model will show `special_sword` for items with `special_sword` NBT tag, and delegate to the next pack for all other items.

### RPT Templates
```json
{
  "model": {
    "type": "rpt:template",
    "template": "mypack:weapon_template"
  }
}
```
Reuse complex model configurations across multiple items with the template system.
